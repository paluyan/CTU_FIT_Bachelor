The task is to create a program that will compare pairs of triangles. 
Triangles in this task can be entered using side lengths (SSS), a pair of sides and the angle enclosed by them (SUS) 
and a pair of angles adjacent to the specified side (USU).

2 triangles are specified in the plane, each triangle is uniquely specified in one of three ways:
SSS - by the lengths of its sides,
SUS - by the lengths of a pair of sides and the size of the angle enclosed by them (the angle is entered in degrees, the input order is side angle side),
USU - the size of a pair of angles and the length of the adjacent side (angles are entered in degrees, the order of input is angle side angle).

The program reads these numbers from its input and decides on one of the following variants:
whether the entered inputs form a triangle,
whether the given triangles are congruent,
whether the given triangles are similar but not congruent, or
whether the given triangles are completely different.

If the input is invalid, the program must detect this and display an error message. Display the error message on the standard output (not on the error output).

Consider it an error:
none of the three allowed ways of entering a triangle (SSS/SUS/USU), non-numeric entry of side lengths or angle sizes are present in the input,
side length is negative or zero, angle is less than or equal to 0 degrees, or greater than or equal to 180 degrees, missing input data/data (side/angle).
