The task is to create a program that will help operate the control tower radar.

In air traffic control, it is important to watch for potential aircraft collisions.
The radars read the positions of the planes and the program checks the distances between the planes. 
We want to implement a program that, given the coordinates of the planes, will decide where there is a potential collision, 
i.e. which planes are closest to each other.

The program input is the coordinates of the aircraft. 
For simplicity, we assume that the coordinates of the plane are plane, that is, the position of the plane is determined by a pair of numbers x and y. 
The coordinates are in the form of decimal numbers. 
The coordinate is followed by the name of the flight, which is made up of a string of any length, the name is terminated by a line break. 
That is, information about exactly one flight is placed on each line at the input. In this way, very many flights can be entered at the input, 
their number is not known in advance. Entering flights ends with active end-of-file (EOF on stdin).
 The input format is obvious from the samples below.

The output of the program is the distance between the pair of nearest planes. There can be multiple aircraft at this (smallest) distance at the same time. 
The program therefore lists all pairs of flights that are separated by this smallest distance.

The program must handle the input data. If the input data is incorrect, the program detects this, displays an error message, and exits.

An error is considered:
non-numeric coordinates,
missing/remaining square brackets or comma,
less than two flights at the entrance (otherwise the minimum distance is not defined).
Your program will run in a limited test environment. 
It is limited by the runtime (the limit can be seen in the log of the reference solution) and the size of the available memory is also limited.
